# VillanousDifficultyMultipliers
Like Halo's skull system, but in minecraft.

The halo franchise since almost the very beginning has had a system where you can activate "skulls" that modify the game in various ways depending on what you've activated.

So this is basically what I'm doing here. Each difficulty multiplier changes some part of the game to make the game more difficult, easier, or sometimes a little bit of both.

It's a fun little idea that I'm playing around with. One of the major things I do with mods is I always find something new to play with, some new mechanic or feature
I haven't tried yet. In this case I'm trying out several things, proper reflection, the command system, having multiple capability sets running at the same time, and more.

Despite it's simplicity I do believe this is a real good learning experience for me.
